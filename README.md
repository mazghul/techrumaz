# Sample MEAN Stack project

Did this project to learn the basics of Mongo DB and Node.js.

The aim was to create a simple webpage, in which we can upload a .csv files, store them in a database and show the content of the database in a tabular form.
This project is done using MEAN Stack.

MEAN is a javascript framework which stands for 
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- AngularJS
- Node.js

As of now only .csv file upload is implemented. Will implement file conversion soon.
The perk of using MongoDB is our excel file can contain any column name and it can be inserted into the database as a collection.

But to display in the table, a the csv file should be in the following format.

SNo |	TecruitrID	| Domain	  | Percentile | FirstName | lastNameInitialn

 55	| Tck20216	  | web dev	  | 50         | Mazhar    | Syed Asan

 60	| TCk2021625	| Database	| 86         | Saffwan   | Syed Asan

 65	| TCk20216257	| Go Lang	  | 92         | Jiya      | Janani

 70	| TCk2021658	| Testing	  | 77         | Raja      | Ramaraj
